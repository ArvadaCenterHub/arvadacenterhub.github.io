I Do!</span><span class="autoCharStyle3"> </span>, Michael and Agnes are celebrating fifty years of marriage and the rollercoaster of a ride it took to get there. In real-life, two of the Arvada Center’s longtime staff members David and Julie Payne have not only been married for forty years, but they act together too – including past productions of <span class="autoCharStyle3">I Do! I Do! </span>They shared with us recently what it is like to be married in front of an audience, and what it takes to stay happily married in the long run.</p>      <p class="autoParaStyle12"><br /></p>      <p class="autoParaStyle12">Q: Michael and Agnes in <span class="autoCharStyle3">I Do! I Do!</span> have been married for fifty years. How long have you two been married, and what advice do you have for others on creating a relationship together with longevity?</p>      <p class="autoParaStyle12"><br /></p>      <p class="autoParaStyle12">Julie: We celebrated our 40th anniversary last May! The advice I like to give is to be polite to each other. I sometimes hear people speak to their spouse in a way they would never speak to a  stranger. The person you love most in the world deserves at least as good from you as a stranger does.</p>      <p class="autoParaStyle12"><br /></p>      <p class="autoParaStyle12">David: Marry your best friend! Have a shared set of spiritual beliefs and morals. Communication is of the utmost importance in a strong, enduring relationship. Treat and speak to each other with respect. Marriage is not an excuse for bad behavior and poor manners. Never leave when there are disagreements - and there will be disagreements. Admit when you are wrong. Be gracious when you are right. Enjoy each other’s differences and interests. Celebrate the similarities and shared pleasures. Be adventurous in what life presents to you. Celebrate your partner’s victories, and console them when they are hurting. Be there for both the ups and downs. Be a team of equals.</p>      <p class="autoParaStyle12"><br /></p>      <p class="autoParaStyle12">Q: You two have performed together in <span class="autoCharStyle3">I Do! I Do!</span> What is it like playing a married couple onstage? How much of your real marriage seeps in?</p>      <p class="autoParaStyle12"><br /></p>      <p class="autoParaStyle12">Julie: We have been in this show for two different venues, and really enjoyed it both times - although it is a lot of show for two people to carry. Playing a married couple onstage, for us,  created an automatic comfort level, a sense of trust, and there was built-in chemistry that was natural and didn’t have to be cultivated. Real marriage definitely seeps into the process. Although we were not exactly like Agnes and Michael, it was easy to play genuine emotion in the context of imaginary circumstances, because we understood the ups and downs of our own marriage.</p>      <p class="autoParaStyle12"><br /></p>      <p class="autoParaStyle12">David: I love being onstage with Julie. While the  events of the show are not the same as ours,  they did inform us of the myriad of life events that await any couple, and provided a bit of warning, in some cases. For me, the part of our real marriage that seeped in was my joy and love of Julie. The parts of the plot that are about Michael and Agnes’ love and happiness were easiest to identify with and draw from.</p>      <p class="autoParaStyle12"><br /></p>      <p class="autoParaStyle12">Q: Some of the themes of <span class="autoCharStyle3">I Do! I Do!</span> can seem pretty outdated now. In what positive ways do you think we as a society have grown since the musical was written in 1966?</p>      <p class="autoParaStyle12"><br /></p>      <p class="autoParaStyle12">Julie: It’s funny because when I think of this show, I don’t think about the outdated themes, although they certainly exist. The show was not only written in a different time, it was set in an even earlier time period when attitudes about women were vastly different from the 1960s. These kinds of musicals and plays are a look back, in my opinion, not to be horrified by but to learn from, and to look at how we’ve grown as a society and will continue to grow. What does stay in my mind is the universal theme concerning marriage, not so much in gender roles but in experiencing marital trials, triumphs, and emotions. Certain things have not changed in relationships, and if human nature remains consistent, probably never will. Two human beings agreeing to a lifetime commitment will have times when things are wonderful and when they are challenging. They will without a doubt have feelings of tremendous love for each other and at other times extreme aggravation. They will navigate finances, family, time management, joy, grief, sorrow - all of it. The real gift comes when two people get on the roller coaster, fasten their seatbelts, and agree not to step out of the car until the ride comes to a complete stop. That’s just what Agnes and Michael do. Succeeding at fifty years of marriage is a lot less common now than it was then.</p>      <p class="autoParaStyle12"><br /></p>      <p class="autoParaStyle12">David: The musical and the original play span a fifty-year marriage from the late 1800’s to almost the mid-1900’s. It is a period piece in that regard, and back then women were most often measured by the success and careers of their husbands, and the children they raised. They were most often defined by motherhood. They were not often seen as contributing much of value when they were past a certain age and the children were grown. Obviously, and thankfully, this perception has greatly altered! Women are not limited in their interests and aspirations nearly as much as they were, and age does not have to be the deciding factor of a woman’s value.</p>      <p class="autoParaStyle12"><br /></p>      <p class="autoParaStyle12">Q: What do you enjoy most about being able to work together?</p>      <p class="autoParaStyle12"><br /></p>      <p class="autoParaStyle12">Julie: We love working together. We met in college as theatre majors and haven’t stopped doing theatre together since. My best day is any day spent with David.</p>      <p class="autoParaStyle12"><br /></p>      <p class="autoParaStyle12">David: Julie and I started working together in earnest in 1985, as actors, writers, directors, and producers, and teachers.  All of our career paths and various avenues of work have intersected and kept us together through the years. I could spend every day working with her, because every day is different and interesting and fulfilling. She is my best friend and partner in life!</p>    </div>    <img src="assets/images/item_6514.jpg" class="pageItem" alt="Rectangle" style="left:1444px !important;top:206px !important;" id="item6514"/>    <div id="item6519" class="pageItem" alt="Press clipping from past performance of I Do  I Do  featuring Julie and David Payne ">      <p class="autoParaStyle14">Press clipping from past performance of <span class="autoCharStyle5">I Do!
