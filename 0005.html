During the pandemic, thanks to philanthropic funding from the Genesee Mountain Foundation, Bowen Family Performing Arts Fund, MDU Resources, Virginia Hill Charitable Fund and others, Robblee and fellow actor Zachary Andrews filmed a virtual version of her historical children’s play <span class="autoCharStyle3">Yesterado</span> which was co-written and also starred Mitch Slevc. This production was given for free to students at an important time when they were in hybrid learning models, and with no hope of a field trip to the Arvada Center. Now as we move back to in-person programming, we are excited that Robblee will not only be playing a dog in this fall’s comedy <span class="autoCharStyle3">Sylvia</span>, but will also be directing a menagerie of animal/actors in next spring’s <span class="autoCharStyle3">Animal Farm</span>.</p>      <p class="autoParaStyle12"><br /></p>      <p class="autoParaStyle12">Q: In <span class="autoCharStyle3">Sylvia</span> you will be playing a dog, and in next spring’s repertory season you will be directing <span class="autoCharStyle3">Animal Farm</span>. As an actor and director, how do you approach creating animal characters?</p>      <p class="autoParaStyle12"><br /></p>      <p class="autoParaStyle12"><br /></p>      <p class="autoParaStyle12 col-break-before"><br /></p>      <p class="autoParaStyle12"><br /></p>      <p class="autoParaStyle12"><br /></p>      <p class="autoParaStyle12"><br /></p>      <p class="autoParaStyle12"><br /></p>      <p class="autoParaStyle12">Robblee: I like for animal characters to have as rich of an emotional life as humans do...and/or the full-blast particularities of being non-human–whichever serves the story best. Everyone does things you can observe but not fully grasp– one of my favorites is how two stranger dogs recognize each other from down the sidewalk...how they stand at a diagonal, leaning on their leashes, utterly absorbed in the experience of seeing each other. They have never met, but they recognize each other.  WHAT is going on there exactly?? I don’t know, but I do know animals evoke strong feelings and make us curious--and that is a great place for an actor to be.</p>      <p class="autoParaStyle12"><br /></p>      <p class="autoParaStyle12">Q: <span class="autoCharStyle3">Animal Farm</span> is a particularly timely choice right now. What do you hope that patrons take away from it, particularly the school groups that will be attending?</p>      <p class="autoParaStyle12"><br /></p>      <p class="autoParaStyle12 col-break-before"><br /></p>      <p class="autoParaStyle12"><br /></p>      <p class="autoParaStyle12"><br /></p>      <p class="autoParaStyle12"><br /></p>      <p class="autoParaStyle12"><br /></p>      <p class="autoParaStyle12">Robblee: I hope people leave with curiosity and questions-- about how we treat each other, what drives us to behave as we do, and what we actually get from our usual modes of operating. I also hope folks walk out appreciating the elegance of George Orwell’s writing-- the sharpness of his thinking.  <span class="autoCharStyle3">Animal Farm</span> is such a brilliant capture of the patterns we fall into over and over again.</p>      <p class="autoParaStyle12"><br /></p>      <p class="autoParaStyle12">Q: Are there any other animal roles you’d like to take on?</p>      <p class="autoParaStyle12"><br /></p>      <p class="autoParaStyle12">Robblee: Let’s see...the stage version of Grumpy Cat!</p>      <p class="autoParaStyle12"><br /></p>      <p class="autoParaStyle12">Q: We loved the virtual version of <span class="autoCharStyle3">Yesterado</span> that was created during the pandemic so students could still participate in theatre while they were in hybrid learning models. Were there any other silver linings that the pandemic brought to your life?</p>      <p class="autoParaStyle12"><br /></p>      <p class="autoParaStyle12"><br /></p>      <p class="autoParaStyle12 col-break-before">Robblee: Filming <span class="autoCharStyle3">Yesterado</span> was delightful–a show I love with incredible people all excited to do what they do again... so rejuvenating!  During the pandemic, my husband and I lived in a small town called La Veta for a good while, staying next-door to dear friends.  That place–there was just something about it that worked for me.  The ratio of nature to man-made things? The nearness to horses, deer, cows, dogs, foxes, chickens, eagles, and even one disgruntled zonkey?  The impossible rock formations and occasional bouts of fierce wind and deep snow?  Nah, probably the bakery next-door made it.</p>      <p class="autoParaStyle12"><br /></p>      <p class="autoParaStyle12">Q: You are so talented in so many ways. Do you have any advice for other actors and creatives who dream of expanding into writing and directing as well?</p>      <p class="autoParaStyle12"><br /></p>      <p class="autoParaStyle12">Robblee: Pay attention to the talented, smart people around you.  They are probably being real sneaky about making complex tasks look easy.  Learn from them. If you are feeling worn down by the systems and opportunities that exist, create your own work. Keep trying.  Find good people.  Make things with them.</p>    </div>    <div id="item7440" class="pageItem" alt="Getting to Know: Jessica Robblee Written by Leslie Simon ">      <p class="autoParaStyle31"><span class="autoCharStyle8">Getting to Know: </span>Jessica Robblee</p>      <p class="autoParaStyle30"><span class="autoCharStyle4">Written by Leslie Simon</span></p>    </div>    <img src="assets/images/item_7463.png" class="pageItem" alt="Rectangle" style="left:679px !important;top:159px !important;" id="item7463"/>    <button class="pageItem" id="item7469" data-id="7469" name="Button 10" onclick="nav.to(2);" alt="Button 10">      <div class="pageItem state btn-off">        <img src="assets/images/item_7472.png" class="pageItem" alt="Rectangle" id="item7472"/>      </div>    </button>    <div id="item7476" class="pageItem" alt="Jessica Robblee in the title role of Sylvia from the 2021 Arvada Center Black Box Season  Photo: Amanda Tipton">      <p class="autoParaStyle19">Jessica Robblee in the title role of <span class="autoCharStyle5">Sylvia</span> from the 2021 Arvada Center Black Box Season.</p>      <p class="autoParaStyle19">Photo: Amanda Tipton</p>    </div>    <button class="pageItem" id="item7499" data-id="7499" name="Button 11" onclick="nav.to(6);" alt="Button 11">      <div class="pageItem state btn-off">        <img src="assets/images/item_7502.png" class="pageItem" alt="Rectangle" id="item7502"/>      </div>    </button>    <img src="assets/images/item_7635.jpg" class="pageItem" alt="Image by Amanda Tipton Photography   FB- Amanda Tipton-Photographer   IG -  amandatiptonphotography" style="left:1442px !important;top:206px !important;" id="item7635"/>    <div id="item7652" class="pageItem" alt="Robblee squares off with Kate Gleason in Sylvia  Photo: Amanda Tipton">      <p class="autoParaStyle32">Robblee squares off with Kate Gleason in <span class="autoCharStyle5">Sylvia</span>.</p>      <p class="autoParaStyle32">Photo: Amanda Tipton</p>    </div>    <button class="pageItem" id="item8565" data-id="8565" name="Button 18" onclick="nav.to(2);" alt="Button 18">      <div class="pageItem state btn-off">        <div id="item8560" class="pageItem singleline" alt="  Main Menu ">          <p class="autoParaStyle4">&lt;  Main Menu</p>        </div>      </div>    </button>  </div></div><div id="prefooter" style="float:left;height:1px;">&nbsp;</div></div><div id="in5footer">Built with <a href="http://ajarproductions.com/pages/products/in5/?ref=footer" target="_blank" >In5</a>.</div></div></body></html>
